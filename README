BEGINNING OF NOTES BY WYATT:

* TFT display guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qnB5gsp8eE&t=2s
* SD card guide: https://01001000.xyz/2020-08-09-Tutorial-STM32CubeIDE-SD-card/
* All the SPI and GPIO pin assignments are made in the .ioc file.
* SCK, MISO, and MOSI are automaticly assigned by the SPI enabled in the .ioc
* ^ but CS, RESET, and DC need to be assigned manually.
* The ili9341.h file and main.h file will need to reflect the .ioc file pin assignments. 
* I used stack size = 512 for the display/SD thread. Testing lower values has caused a fault in the past.
* Will need to change the "startup file" from f4xxxx to whichever board we are using.
* None of the display's touch screen pins are used (i.e. T_IRQ1, T_DO, T_DIN, T_CS, T_CLK)

I was on an f4xxx board, but I used the following SPI/GPIOs for the SD/Display:
SD:
	SCK		->	PB10
	MISO	->	PC2
	MOSI	->	PC1
	CS		->	PC3
DISPLAY:
	SD0 (MISO)	->	n/a (specify master only transmit in .ioc)
	LED			->	+3.3V
	SCK			->	PA5
	SDI	(MOSI)	->	PA7
	DC			->	PB1
	RESET		->	PB0
	CS			->	PA4
	VCC			->  +5V
	
I uploaded my wyatt.c and wyatt.h code, but it doesn't look like main.c is configured for FreeRTOS to run.
Once it is, ADD THE FOLLOWING CODE AS ITS OWN THREAD:
  
*   HOW THE FSM WORKS:
	The display initializes by showing the names of the files on the SD card, and blinking to show which file is currently hovered over.
	Change boolean variables "sel_next" and "sel_prev" to highlight files other than the one currently highlighted.
	change boolean variable "readFile" to open the file that's currently hovered over and access its contents.
	change boolean variable "viewDirectory" to close the file you're reading and view the list of file names again.
	
	changing "readFile" while already reading a file does nothing.
	changing "viewDirectory" while already viewing the directory does nothing.
